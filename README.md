- Which type of crimes are the mos frequent?  
- Which are the days that most of the crimes have been done?  
- Which is the day of most incidents?
- Can we summarize in a better graph?

- A link to the dataset found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ijzp-q8t2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).
- Helper files for database operation and classes (see helpers folder)

The development of the dataset analysis is published at the webpage [here](https://daqsyspty.com/2021/05/my-crime-analysis/)


The project here developed gathered some skills for data visualization, construction of classes and database manipulation.
- We used data.gov data from the Chicago Police Department to get all the fields that we will analyze for making data visualization insights.
- Stablished a class to handle database insertion and query.
- We made some basic statistics of which is the most common day of crime and hours.
- We list all important data insights in one graph, we used a heatmap to view the days vs crimes incidents.
